## Introduction to Angular

Angular is a development framework for building modern and scalable web applications using JavaScript (or TypeScript). It offers a robust and flexible structure to efficiently create Single Page Applications (SPA).

## Installation

To start developing with Angular, you need to have Node.js and Angular CLI installed. If you don't have them yet, you can install them by following the steps in the [official Angular documentation](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local).

```bash
# Install Angular CLI globally
npm install -g @angular/cli
